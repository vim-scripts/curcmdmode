This plugin has no value in Vim7 since it has a new built-in function called getcmdtype().

This plugin provides a small library of functions and mappings and a framework to extend Vim's command-line mode in a way that is not possible by using Vim's built-in features alone.

This was originally part of the chcmdmode.vim plugin, but I have extracted the generic part out and created this new plugin which can be shared by multiple scripts. For description and usage please see the script header.
